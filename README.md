# Just_Watch_Python_Web_Scraping
This project demonstrates web scraping techniques to extract movie and TV show data from JustWatch, a platform aggregating content from multiple streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu. Using Python and BeautifulSoup, the project navigates and parses the JustWatch website to collect detailed information about available content. The scraped data is then processed, filtered, and analyzed with Pandas, offering insights into trends and patterns. Finally, the results are exported to a CSV file for further use or visualization.
